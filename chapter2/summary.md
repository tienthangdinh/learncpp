1. Compilation Phase (Object File Generation)
Each .cpp file is compiled separately into an object file (.o), and io.h only helps with making sure function calls are valid.

Compiling main.cpp (g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o)
The compiler sees function calls like readNumber(); and writeAnswer(x, y);.
But since these functions are only declared in io.h, the compiler does not know their implementation.
Instead, it marks them as "unresolved external symbols" in main.o, meaning:
"I know these functions exist somewhere, but I donâ€™t have their definitions yet."
ðŸ‘‰ At this stage, main.o does NOT contain the actual function code for readNumber() and writeAnswer(), only a reference to them.

Compiling io.cpp (g++ -c io.cpp -o io.o)
Here, io.cpp contains both function declarations (via io.h) and their actual implementations.
The compiler compiles readNumber() and writeAnswer() into machine code inside io.o.
The symbol table of io.o stores:
scss
Copy
Edit
readNumber()  â†’ Address X
writeAnswer() â†’ Address Y
This tells the linker:
"Hey, if you're looking for readNumber(), it's located at address X inside io.o."
ðŸ‘‰ Now io.o has the actual function implementations.

2. Linking Phase (Resolving Function Calls)
At this point, we have:

main.o with unresolved references to readNumber() and writeAnswer().
io.o with the actual function implementations.
When we run:

sh
Copy
Edit
g++ main.o io.o -o my_program
The linker (ld) combines the object files:

It scans main.o and sees that readNumber() and writeAnswer() are unresolved references.
It scans io.o and finds the matching function definitions in the symbol table.
It connects the function calls in main.o to the function implementations in io.o.
The final executable my_program is created.
Now, when you run:

sh
Copy
Edit
./my_program
The CPU executes main().
When readNumber() is called, the program jumps to the linked address inside io.o.
After execution, it returns to main() and continues.
Key Takeaways
ðŸ”¹ io.h is not involved in linkingâ€”itâ€™s only for the compiler to know function signatures.
ðŸ”¹ main.o only contains references to readNumber() and writeAnswer().
ðŸ”¹ io.o contains the actual function definitions, which the linker resolves and connects.
ðŸ”¹ The linker matches function calls from main.o to their actual implementations in io.o using the symbol table.






Yes! You Are Absolutely Right! ðŸŽ¯
Youâ€™ve grasped the concept perfectly! Let me summarize and confirm your understanding:

1. io.h Is Only Used During Compilation
io.h has no effect during linking.
Its only purpose is to tell the compiler that these functions exist somewhere.
It allows main.cpp to compile successfully into main.o without knowing where the actual function implementations are.
2. main.o Does Not Know About io.cpp, Only Unresolved Symbols
When main.cpp is compiled, the compiler sees function calls like:
cpp
Copy
Edit
int x { readNumber() };
writeAnswer(x, y);
Since io.h provides only declarations, the compiler does not generate any code for readNumber() and writeAnswer() in main.o.
Instead, main.o contains something like:
nginx
Copy
Edit
U readNumber
U writeAnswer
where U means "unresolved external symbol".
ðŸ‘‰ At this stage, main.o does not care where these functions come from.

3. The Linker Searches for Any Matching Symbols
When we run:
sh
Copy
Edit
g++ main.o io.o -o my_program
The linker (ld) does not know about io.h or io.cppâ€”it just looks at all object files (.o) that were compiled.
It searches for any definition of readNumber() and writeAnswer(), and when it finds them inside io.o, it links them.
ðŸ‘‰ The linker does not care about any relationship between io.h and io.cpp!
It only matches function names between main.o and io.o. io.h is completely irrelevant at this point.
